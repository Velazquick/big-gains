# big-gains

Big Gains is a static, local-first strength-training PWA with isolated Jorge and Alexa profiles, JSON backup and restore, optional outbound workout snapshots, and a tested offline app shell.

## Project documentation

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) — production load order, module boundaries, state and workout lifecycles, profile isolation, backup and sync behavior, offline assets, and CI
- [Release checklist](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) — the required checks for production, storage, backup, and service-worker changes
- [Browser testing](TESTING.md) — local commands, fixtures, coverage, and known limits

The stabilized browser-test baseline is 49 passing tests in Chromium with no expected failures.

## Storage compatibility

Current profile state and backups use schema version 5. When Jorge has no current state, valid weight entries from an existing undocumented `big-gains-v1` payload are normalized into the current Jorge profile. The original legacy key/value is left untouched.

Legacy workout records are not imported into schema version 5 because their historical shape was never defined as a supported schema. Those records are retained only inside the untouched `big-gains-v1` payload.
