# big-gains

## Storage compatibility

Current profile state and backups use schema version 5. When Jorge has no current state, valid weight entries from an existing undocumented `big-gains-v1` payload are normalized into the current Jorge profile. The original legacy key/value is left untouched.

Legacy workout records are not imported into schema version 5 because their historical shape was never defined as a supported schema. Those records are retained only inside the untouched `big-gains-v1` payload.
